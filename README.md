## Vue-Do ##
(get it? like to-do, but with vue in it :') )

## What is this? ##
My first vue app, I've been curious about this framework so decided to try and put together something that does a few things:
* Implements basic CRD (no.. no update.... yet) functionality around a to-do list.
* http requests to a placeholder api for above actions.
* super basic application routing.
* flexbox css (i'm still figuring out how this one works.)

I built this while following through Brad Traversy's walkthrough available on Youtube, if you are looking for guidance on how to start creating something using vue,  would recommend / 10 there, he punches out a good understanding of how the framework is put together within an hour or two.

To do, on vue do:
* Application-level state management?
* needs more material design.
