        This is Rol's first Vue Application just to see what it's about.
        The application is super basic, making simple HTTP requests to
        display a list of todos. You can add new ones and delete them from the list as well.
      </p>
      <div class="break"></div>
      <p>
        As you can probably tell having gotten here, the app also implements
        basic routing, allowing you to access both mind blowing todo and about pages.
